# Exo-Odyssey

Exo-odyssey provides an interactive game, where the users are able to explore the exoplanets discovered, making complex scientific concepts accessible and captivating for middle school students. It immerses the player to participate in the exoplanet exploration of NASA with the goal of discovering habitable planets and evidence of life beyond (2024). 
Using official data from NASA’s exoplanet research, Exo-odyssey allows the player to explores distant exoplanets in search of the perfect habitable world. Their goal is retrieving the relevant information about the conditions and characteristics of the exoplanet, through customized minigames, quizzes and an immersive simulation. These include, its type, mass, equilibrium temperature, tidal heating, and atmosphere. 

For the exoplanet LP 791-18:

**Type:** LP 791-18 d is classified as an Earth-sized exoplanet.
**Radius:** It has a radius of approximately 1.03 ± 0.04 R⊕.
**Mass:** The planet's mass is estimated at about 0.9 M⊕.
**Equilibrium Temperature:** LP 791-18 d has an equilibrium temperature ranging from 300 to 400 K.
**Tidal Heating:** The gravitational interaction with a nearby sub-Neptune causes tidal heating, which likely results in volcanic activity on its surface.
**Atmosphere:** The planet may have the potential for a dense atmosphere, possibly conducive to water condensation on the permanently shadowed side

The game progresses through multiple levels, where players complete tasks assigned by the head of the “Exoplanet Exploration Administration (EEA) ” mission control, all while investigating each exoplanet’s environment, atmosphere, unique characteristics, and more. This engaging journey motivates players to continue learning and exploring. Upon completing each mission, the head of the EEA will quiz players on what they’ve learned. Successfully finishing the mission and answering the questions correctly unlocks rewards and grants access to the next exoplanet, where a brand-new adventure awaits.



## Description
Exoplanet exploration: 
The National Aeronautics or Space Administration [NASA] defines an exoplanet as any planet beyond our solar systems. There are more than 5,600 exoplanets confirmed out of the billions that we believe exist. The exploration made by NASA has the purpose of discovering Earth-like planets with the potential of finding new habitable celestial bodies (2023).

## Future developments

- Mini-games for each parameter: various captivating gameplays
- Additional measurements: deeper understanding of exoplanets 
- Interactive map: locate exoplanets distances and locations
- User Registration and Progress Tracking: save the progress for each user
- Collectible card: after each exoplanet mission complete, gain the card of the specific extrasolar planet

## Accesibility 
Video games have become an increasingly valuable tool in education, particularly when it comes to engaging students in complex subjects such as science. Finland, Japan, and South Korea have integrated video games into more than 70% of their schools, improving learning outcomes in subjects like mathematics and science. For instance 82% of South Korean schools report using video games to enhance problem-solving and cognitive skills​.
Nonetheless, there remains a significant gap when it comes to educational video games designed specifically for visually impaired students. Less than 2% of all educational games are designed with accessibility in mind, and unfortunately a small fraction of these focus on science. This gap in accessible educational resources is particularly noticeable in subjects like exoplanetary science​.
Studies have shown that video games significantly improve cognitive functions such as memory retention and problem-solving skills. According to a PLOS ONE study, students using educational video games see a 25% improvement in memory and a 32% boost in problem-solving compared to students who rely solely on traditional learning methods​.
These numbers are especially promising for visually impaired students, who often benefit from non-traditional learning methods, like audio descriptions and interactive experiences. In Australia a study focusing on blind students learning astronomy through audio-based video games demonstrated a 30% improvement in content retention​.
The accessibility of educational games for visually impaired students is a crucial issue. Tools like Blitab and other braille-compatible devices are starting to make educational content more accessible. According to a report by the Mada Center, 88% of visually impaired students showed improved engagement and academic performance when using audio-based learning tools​.
 In an educational video game that focuses on exoplanetary science, descriptive audio could be used to explain complex scientific concepts, enabling visually impaired students to "experience" the material through sound.
Motivation also plays a significant role in learning, and video games are particularly effective in keeping students engaged. A study by the Harvard Graduate School of Education found that 71% of students using educational video games felt more motivated and engaged with the content​.
For visually impaired students, the opportunity to explore, make decisions, and solve problems within an interactive, audio-driven game could make learning more engaging and enjoyable. In a game about exoplanetary exploration, students could be presented with scientific data in an immersive way, allowing them to experiment and understand the concepts in real time.
